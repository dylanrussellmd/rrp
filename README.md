# Research Reproducibility Project 

This repository acts as my launch point for all reproducibility tools I use in my research, including R packages and Dockerfiles.

Goals of my reproducible research include:
- Projects can be reproduced by anybody regardless of date, location, language, or OS.
- The manuscript can be reproduced by anyone with the Dockerfile and associated necessary resources.
